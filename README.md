Learning Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Python *behave*

## About
This project is a two-fold opportunity to exercise skills in software development by using GitHub for project management, as well as to supplement my skills as a developer by studying BDD through the use of *behave*. 

Development of this project starts with following the tutorial on the API website - initial commits would reflect the progress made on the tutorial. Once finished, project development will then focus on creating a sample application where *behave* can be applied. Ideas include writing a mock application, or writing an end-to-end test for my little project on [a simple chat program](https://github.com/JedCainglet/Unsecured-Networked-Simple-Chat-Program) that I am hoping to develop more into a fully functional application much later in the future.
